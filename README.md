### Company Introduction
Apprentice Chef, Inc. is an innovative company with a unique spin on cooking at home. Developed for the busy professional that has little to no skills in the kitchen, they offer a wide selection of daily-prepared gourmet meals delivered directly to your door. Each meal set takes at most 30 minutes to finish cooking at home and also comes with Apprentice Chef's award-winning disposable cookware (i.e. pots, pans, baking trays, and utensils), allowing for fast and easy cleanup. Ordering meals is very easy given their user-friendly online platform and mobile app.

### Case Context
After 3 years serving customers across the San Francisco Bay Area, the executives at Apprentice Chef have come to realize that over 90% of their revenue comes from customers that have been ordering meal sets for 12 months or less. Given this information, they would like to better understand how much revenue to expect from each customer within their first year of orders.

Thus, they have hired me on a full-time contract to:
- Analyze their data
- Develop my top insights
- Build a machine learning model to predict revenue over the first year of each customer’s life cycle.

In order to appropriately prepare the data for this analysis, the data science team at Apprentice Chef has queried, sampled, and verified a dataset of approximately 2,000 customers. Each customer met at least one of the following criteria:
1. At least one purchase per month for a total of 11 of their first 12 months
2. At least one purchase per quarter and at least 15 purchases throughout their first year

The data science team assures me that their dataset engineering techniques are statistically sound and represent the true picture of Apprentice Chef’s customers. To help me in my task, Apprentice Chef, Inc. has provided me with the dataset and additional information about the company.

### Business Question
Build a machine learning model to predict how much revenue to expect over the first year of each customer's life cycle.
